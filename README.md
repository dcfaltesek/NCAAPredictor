# NCAA Bracket Predictions

This project is an extension of [work done during the early phase](https://medium.com/@danfaltesek/modeling-march-madness-2020-a-study-in-data-aesthetics-8f33166c2161) of the Pandemic on zoom with my Cultural Analytics student research team.

Executive summary: this project relies on a random forest model to predict the outcome of NCAA tournament games using models trained on the last two years of tournament games.

Step one: use the data dictionary to select the variables for your recipe.

Step two: run the split and model until it responds nicely.

Third: Enter your bracket into a file like "new.csv."

Step Four: Upload that CSV into R and run it as the argument passed in the return() function.

Step Five: run the code in an is6 bracket to yield predictions.

Step Six: you won't profit, the best models only get it right about two-thirds of the time.
